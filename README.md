# Map your workouts

This is an interactive Fitness Tracker App that enables users to manage and visualize their running and cycling activities on a map. The app uses modern JavaScript features, geolocation, and the Leaflet library for a dynamic and responsive user experience.

## Features

‚Ä¢ Track Activities: Log running or cycling activities with details such as distance, duration, cadence, and elevation gain.

‚Ä¢ Interactive Map: Visualize activity markers on a map based on your current location using the browser's Geolocation API.

‚Ä¢ Dynamic UI: Display activity details in a clean and intuitive interface with animations and transitions.

‚Ä¢ Local Storage: Save all activities in the browser's local storage.

‚Ä¢ Smooth Navigation: Click on any activity to automatically pan the map to its location.

## How the app works

1. The app retrieves the user‚Äôs current location using the Geolocation API.

2. Users can add new activities (running or cycling) via a simple form.
   
3. Activities are displayed both as map markers and in a list.

4. All logged activities persist across sessions using Local Storage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies used

‚Ä¢ JavaScript (ES6+): Classes, modern features, and modular design.

‚Ä¢ Leaflet JS: Interactive maps and markers.

‚Ä¢ HTML5: Semantic structure.

‚Ä¢ CSS3: Responsive design and animations.

‚Ä¢ LocalStorage API: Persistent data storage in the browser.
